## 🔴About
"The Crooked Woods" is a singleplayer horror game where the player takes the role of a volunteer sent to rescue five missing children in the woods. You can choose one child to be their companion and rescue the others while there is something lurking in the darkness. Your objective is simple, to find all the missing children that is hiding somewhere in the forest, and leave the forest before something gets you. I created all the scripts, here are some details about Unfound's development
